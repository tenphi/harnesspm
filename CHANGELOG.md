# Changelog

## 0.1.0

The first release: a proof of concept that covers every scenario of the [specification](docs/spec/README.md) (version 0.7 draft).

- **Team harness:** `init`, `sync`, `sync --check`, `status`, `why` and `check`. Discovery from dependencies, `extends`, one version per package, `exclude`, `replace` and `patch`, the managed block in `AGENTS.md`, skill and rule links, a docs index and `harnesspm.lock.json`.
- **Added harnesses:** `add`, `remove` and `update`, for a team's or a person's own harness on top of a repository, with user and local scope, project entries and a `SessionStart` hook.
- **Executables and trust:** scripts, hooks, MCP servers, permissions and sub-agents for Claude Code and Codex; `trust` with `true` or `"pin"`; `run`, `mcp` and `approve`. Nothing that widens an agent's permissions is written when the agent's model runs harnesspm.
- **Monorepos, `fetch` and `new`:** a block per workspace; downloading the locked harness packages for jobs without an install; templates for every unit kind and for patches.
- **Docs index:** built from `.md` and `.mdx` pages, titled by frontmatter `title`, else the first heading. Found by the first pilot, `@tenphi/glaze`.

Known limits: `npm install <pkg>` and `pnpm add` do not run the install hook, so run `npx harnesspm sync` after them; Codex outputs are checked against its source and docs only; Yarn Plug'n'Play and Windows are not tested.
